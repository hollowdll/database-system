# Database data types

The database uses strongly typed data types for document data. Each field in a document has a data type, field name and value. The engine doesn't allow fields without valid data type.

For example:

```json
{
    [DocumentId] _id: 1
    [Text] "name": "Some name"
}
```

This document has 2 fields: `_id` which is generated by the engine, and `name` which has a text value. `_id` is the document id and has data type `DocumentId`, and `name` has data type `Text`.

These are all the data types currently supported:

- `DocumentId`
- `Int32`
- `Int64`
- `Decimal`
- `Bool`
- `Text`

Data type  | Description
---------- | -----------
DocumentId | 64-bit unsigned integer. Only document id can have this.
Int32      | 32-bit signed integer for numbers.
Int64      | 64-bit signed integer for numbers.
Decimal    | 64-bit floating point number for decimal numbers.
Bool       | Boolean type for values true and false.
Text       | UTF-8 string for dynamic texts.

Note that these might change in the future. New data types will be added in later versions.

## Example usage

Here is an example usage of all the data types:

```json
{
    [DocumentId] _id: 1
    [Int32] "int32_field": 1234567
    [Int64] "int64_field": -9999999999999
    [Decimal] "decimal_field": 3.14
    [Bool] "bool_field": true
    [Text] "text_field": "Some text that has dynamic size"
}
```
